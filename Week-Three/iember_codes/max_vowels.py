Hereâ€™s the Leetcode75-style solution for the problem **"Maximum Number of Vowels in a Substring of Given Length."**

### Problem Breakdown:
We are given a string `s` and an integer `k`. The task is to find the maximum number of vowels in any contiguous substring of length `k`. The vowels are 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', and 'u'.

### Approach:
1. **Sliding Window Technique**:
   - We use a sliding window of size `k` to count the number of vowels in the current window.
   - As the window slides through the string, we update the count by adding the new character that enters the window and subtracting the one that exits the window.
   - Keep track of the maximum number of vowels encountered during the process.

### Python Solution:

```python
class Solution:
    def maxVowels(self, s: str, k: int) -> int:
        vowels = {'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u'}  # Set of vowel characters
        max_vowels = 0
        current_vowels = 0
        
        # Initialize the count for the first window of size k
        for i in range(k):
            if s[i] in vowels:
                current_vowels += 1
        max_vowels = current_vowels
        
        # Slide the window across the string
        for i in range(k, len(s)):
            # Remove the influence of the character going out of the window
            if s[i - k] in vowels:
                current_vowels -= 1
            # Add the influence of the new character coming into the window
            if s[i] in vowels:
                current_vowels += 1
            # Update the max vowel count
            max_vowels = max(max_vowels, current_vowels)
        
        return max_vowels

# Example 1
solution = Solution()
print(solution.maxVowels("abciiidef", 3))  # Output: 3

# Example 2
print(solution.maxVowels("aeiou", 2))  # Output: 2

# Example 3
print(solution.maxVowels("leetcode", 3))  # Output: 2
```

### Explanation:

1. **Initialization**:
   - We start by counting the vowels in the first window of length `k`. For each character in the first window, if it's a vowel, we increment the `current_vowels` count.

2. **Sliding Window**:
   - We slide the window from index `k` to the end of the string.
   - For each new position of the window, we update the vowel count:
     - Subtract 1 from `current_vowels` if the character that is leaving the window (i.e., at index `i - k`) is a vowel.
     - Add 1 to `current_vowels` if the new character (i.e., at index `i`) entering the window is a vowel.

3. **Max Vowel Count**:
   - After updating the vowel count for the current window, we compare it with `max_vowels` and update `max_vowels` if necessary.

4. **Return the Result**:
   - After processing all windows, return `max_vowels`, which contains the maximum number of vowels in any substring of length `k`.

### Time Complexity:
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where `n` is the length of the string `s`. We traverse the string once to check each window of size `k`.
  
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), since we are only using a fixed amount of extra space (set for vowels and a few integer variables).

### Examples:

#### Example 1:
Input: s = "abciiidef", k = 3
Output: 3
Explanation: The substring "iii" contains 3 vowel letters.
```

#### Example 2:
Input: s = "aeiou", k = 2
Output: 2
Explanation: Any substring of length 2 contains 2 vowels.
```

#### Example 3:
Input: s = "leetcode", k = 3
Output: 2
Explanation: Substrings like "lee" and "eet" contain 2 vowels.
```

### Constraints:
- `1 <= s.length <= 10^5`
- `s` consists of lowercase English letters.
- `1 <= k <= s.length`

### Key Points:
- Using a sliding window approach allows us to efficiently calculate the number of vowels in any substring of length `k` without having to recalculate the number of vowels from scratch for every window.
- We keep the complexity linear, making the solution feasible for large input sizes up to \(10^5\).
