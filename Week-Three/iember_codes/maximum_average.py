Hereâ€™s the Leetcode75-style solution for the problem **"Maximum Average Subarray I."**

### Problem Breakdown:
We are given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`. We need to find the contiguous subarray of length `k` that has the maximum average value. The result should have a calculation error less than \(10^{-5}\).

### Approach:
1. **Sliding Window Approach**:
   - The sliding window approach is efficient for solving this problem because it avoids recalculating sums from scratch for every subarray of length `k`. 
   - First, calculate the sum of the first `k` elements.
   - Then, for each subsequent subarray, slide the window by subtracting the element that falls out of the window and adding the new element that enters the window.
   - Keep track of the maximum sum encountered, and divide by `k` at the end to get the maximum average.

### Python Solution:

```python
class Solution:
    def findMaxAverage(self, nums: list[int], k: int) -> float:
        # Calculate the sum of the first k elements
        current_sum = sum(nums[:k])
        max_sum = current_sum
        
        # Slide the window across the array
        for i in range(k, len(nums)):
            # Update the current sum by sliding the window
            current_sum += nums[i] - nums[i - k]
            max_sum = max(max_sum, current_sum)
        
        # Return the maximum average
        return max_sum / k

# Example 1
solution = Solution()
print(solution.findMaxAverage([1, 12, -5, -6, 50, 3], 4))  # Output: 12.75000

# Example 2
print(solution.findMaxAverage([5], 1))  # Output: 5.00000
```

### Explanation:

1. **Initial Calculation**:
   - We first calculate the sum of the first `k` elements, `current_sum = sum(nums[:k])`, and set this as the `max_sum`.
   
2. **Sliding Window**:
   - Starting from index `k`, for each new element that enters the window, we add that element (`nums[i]`) to `current_sum` and subtract the element that falls out of the window (`nums[i - k]`).
   - We update `max_sum` with the maximum of the current sum and the previous `max_sum`.

3. **Return Maximum Average**:
   - After sliding the window across the array, divide `max_sum` by `k` to get the maximum average and return it.

### Time Complexity:
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where `n` is the length of the `nums` array. We compute the initial sum in O(k) and then update the sum for each sliding window in O(1) for a total of O(n) operations.

- **Space Complexity**: O(1), since we are only using a few extra variables for the sums.

### Examples:

#### Example 1:
```plaintext
Input: nums = [1, 12, -5, -6, 50, 3], k = 4
Output: 12.75000
Explanation: The subarray [12, -5, -6, 50] has the maximum sum of 51, and its average is 12.75.
```

#### Example 2:
```plaintext
Input: nums = [5], k = 1
Output: 5.00000
Explanation: The subarray is just [5], and its average is 5.
```

### Constraints:
- `n == nums.length`
- `1 <= k <= n <= 10^5`
- \(-10^4 \leq \text{nums}[i] \leq 10^4\)

### Key Points:
- The sliding window technique ensures that the problem is solved efficiently in O(n) time by reusing previously calculated sums.
- This approach avoids recalculating the sum from scratch for every subarray of length `k`, which would have been inefficient for large arrays.
