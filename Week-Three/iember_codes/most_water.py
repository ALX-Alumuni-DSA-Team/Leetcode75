Hereâ€™s the Leetcode75-style solution for the problem "Container with Most Water."

### Problem Breakdown:
We are given an array `height` of length `n`, where each element represents the height of a vertical line. The goal is to find two lines that, together with the x-axis, form a container that holds the maximum amount of water. The water contained between two lines is limited by the shorter line, and the width between them is the difference in their indices.

### Approach:
1. **Two-Pointer Approach**:
   - Use two pointers: one starting at the beginning (`left`) and the other at the end (`right`) of the `height` array.
   - The area of water between the two lines is determined by the formula:
     \[
     \text{Area} = \text{min(height[left], height[right])} \times (right - left)
     \]
   - We want to maximize this area.
   - Move the pointer corresponding to the shorter line inward because moving the taller line won't increase the area.

2. **Why Two Pointers Work**:
   - By comparing the two ends and always moving the pointer corresponding to the smaller height, we ensure that we are trying to maximize the width while adjusting the height to the most promising values.

### Python Solution:

```python
class Solution:
    def maxArea(self, height: list[int]) -> int:
        left, right = 0, len(height) - 1
        max_area = 0
        
        while left < right:
            # Calculate the current area
            current_area = min(height[left], height[right]) * (right - left)
            max_area = max(max_area, current_area)
            
            # Move the pointer corresponding to the smaller height
            if height[left] < height[right]:
                left += 1
            else:
                right -= 1
        
        return max_area

# Example 1
solution = Solution()
print(solution.maxArea([1, 8, 6, 2, 5, 4, 8, 3, 7]))  # Output: 49

# Example 2
print(solution.maxArea([1, 1]))  # Output: 1
```

### Explanation:

1. **Initialize Two Pointers**:
   - We start with two pointers: one at the left end (`left = 0`) and the other at the right end (`right = len(height) - 1`).

2. **Calculate Area**:
   - For each pair of lines (`height[left]` and `height[right]`), calculate the area of water they can contain:
     \[
     \text{Area} = \text{min(height[left], height[right])} \times (right - left)
     \]
   - Update `max_area` if the current area is larger than the previously calculated area.

3. **Move the Pointers**:
   - Move the pointer corresponding to the shorter line. This is because the area is constrained by the shorter line, so moving the taller one would not help increase the area.
   - If `height[left] < height[right]`, increment `left`. Otherwise, decrement `right`.

4. **Return the Maximum Area**:
   - After iterating through the array, return `max_area` as the largest area found.

### Time Complexity:
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where `n` is the length of the `height` array. The two-pointer approach processes each element once.
  
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), since we are using only a few extra variables to store the pointers and the maximum area.

### Examples:

#### Example 1:
```plaintext
Input: height = [1, 8, 6, 2, 5, 4, 8, 3, 7]
Output: 49
Explanation: The vertical lines with heights 8 and 7 (at indices 1 and 8) form a container with width 7, and the area is 49.
```

#### Example 2:
```plaintext
Input: height = [1, 1]
Output: 1
Explanation: The only container that can be formed has an area of 1.
```

### Constraints:
- `n == height.length`
- 2 <= `n` <= \(10^5\)
- 0 <= `height[i]` <= \(10^4\)

This two-pointer solution efficiently computes the maximum area by making use of the container's height and width, while minimizing unnecessary calculations.
