Hereâ€™s the Leetcode75-style solution for the problem "Merge Strings Alternately."

### Problem Breakdown:
We are given two strings `word1` and `word2`. We need to merge these strings by alternating their characters. Start with the first character from `word1`, then the first character from `word2`, and so on. If one string is longer than the other, the remaining characters of the longer string are appended to the end of the merged string.

### Approach:
1. **Two Pointers**: 
   - We use two pointers, one for each string (`word1` and `word2`), to alternate the characters.
   - Continue this until one of the strings is fully traversed.
   - If one string has leftover characters, append them to the result.

2. **String Concatenation**:
   - Keep merging the characters alternately, and once you reach the end of one string, concatenate the remaining characters of the longer string to the result.

### Python Solution:

```python
class Solution:
    def mergeAlternately(self, word1: str, word2: str) -> str:
        # Initialize pointers and result string
        i, j = 0, 0
        merged = []
        
        # Alternate characters from word1 and word2
        while i < len(word1) and j < len(word2):
            merged.append(word1[i])
            merged.append(word2[j])
            i += 1
            j += 1
        
        # If any characters are left in word1 or word2, append them to the result
        if i < len(word1):
            merged.append(word1[i:])
        if j < len(word2):
            merged.append(word2[j:])
        
        # Join the list to form the final string
        return ''.join(merged)

# Example 1
solution = Solution()
print(solution.mergeAlternately("abc", "pqr"))  # Output: "apbqcr"

# Example 2
print(solution.mergeAlternately("ab", "pqrs"))  # Output: "apbqrs"

# Example 3
print(solution.mergeAlternately("abcd", "pq"))  # Output: "apbqcd"
```

### Explanation:

1. **Initialize Two Pointers**:
   - `i` for `word1` and `j` for `word2`.
   - Create an empty list `merged` to hold the characters as we alternate between the two strings.

2. **Alternate Characters**:
   - Use a `while` loop to add characters from `word1[i]` and `word2[j]` alternately to the list until one of the strings is fully traversed.

3. **Handle Leftover Characters**:
   - Once one string is exhausted, append any remaining characters from the other string using slicing.

4. **Return the Result**:
   - Join the characters in the `merged` list to form the final merged string.

### Time Complexity:
- **Time Complexity**: O(n + m), where `n` and `m` are the lengths of `word1` and `word2` respectively. We iterate through both strings once.
  
- **Space Complexity**: O(n + m), where `n` and `m` are the lengths of the input strings. The space is used for storing the merged result.

### Examples:

#### Example 1:
Input: word1 = "abc", word2 = "pqr"
Output: "apbqcr"
Explanation: Characters are taken alternately from word1 and word2.
```

#### Example 2:
Input: word1 = "ab", word2 = "pqrs"
Output: "apbqrs"
Explanation: After alternating characters, "rs" from word2 is appended to the result.
```

#### Example 3:
Input: word1 = "abcd", word2 = "pq"
Output: "apbqcd"
Explanation: After alternating characters, "cd" from word1 is appended to the result.
```

This approach efficiently merges the two strings alternately and handles cases where one string is longer than the other.
