Here’s the Leetcode75-style solution for the problem "Greatest Common Divisor of Strings."

### Problem Breakdown:
Given two strings, `str1` and `str2`, we need to find the largest string `x` such that `x` divides both `str1` and `str2`. A string `t` divides another string `s` if and only if `s` can be constructed by concatenating `t` multiple times.

### Approach:
1. **Euclidean Algorithm Analogy**:
   - The problem is analogous to finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers. Instead of numbers, we are working with strings here.
   - The idea is that if `str1 + str2 == str2 + str1`, then a common divisor exists, and the length of the GCD string will be the GCD of the lengths of `str1` and `str2`.
   
2. **Steps**:
   - If `str1 + str2 != str2 + str1`, return `""` because no common divisor string exists.
   - Otherwise, find the GCD of the lengths of `str1` and `str2` and return the substring of `str1` up to that GCD length as the result.

### Python Solution:

```python
import math

class Solution:
    def gcdOfStrings(self, str1: str, str2: str) -> str:
        # Check if str1 + str2 equals str2 + str1, if not, there's no common divisor string.
        if str1 + str2 != str2 + str1:
            return ""
        
        # Find the greatest common divisor of the lengths of the two strings.
        gcd_length = math.gcd(len(str1), len(str2))
        
        # Return the substring of str1 up to the GCD length as the largest common divisor string.
        return str1[:gcd_length]

# Example 1
solution = Solution()
print(solution.gcdOfStrings("ABCABC", "ABC"))  # Output: "ABC"

# Example 2
print(solution.gcdOfStrings("ABABAB", "ABAB"))  # Output: "AB"

# Example 3
print(solution.gcdOfStrings("LEET", "CODE"))    # Output: ""
```

### Explanation:
1. **`str1 + str2 != str2 + str1`**:
   - This step checks if there’s a valid common divisor string. If the concatenation of the two strings in both orders isn’t the same, it means they don’t share a common divisor.

2. **`math.gcd(len(str1), len(str2))`**:
   - This finds the GCD of the lengths of the two strings. The largest common divisor string must have this length.

3. **`str1[:gcd_length]`**:
   - Return the substring of `str1` up to the length of the GCD, as this will be the largest string that divides both `str1` and `str2`.

### Time Complexity:
- **Time Complexity**: O(n + m), where `n` and `m` are the lengths of `str1` and `str2` respectively. This is because we concatenate and check the strings once, and finding the GCD of two numbers is a constant time operation.
  
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), since we use only a few extra variables, and the result is derived directly from the input.

### Examples:

#### Example 1:
Input: str1 = "ABCABC", str2 = "ABC"
Output: "ABC"
Explanation: "ABC" is the largest string that can divide both str1 and str2.
```

#### Example 2:
Input: str1 = "ABABAB", str2 = "ABAB"
Output: "AB"
Explanation: "AB" is the largest string that can divide both str1 and str2.
```

#### Example 3:
Input: str1 = "LEET", str2 = "CODE"
Output: ""
Explanation: There is no common divisor string for "LEET" and "CODE".
```

This solution leverages both string concatenation properties and the mathematical GCD concept to efficiently solve the problem.
