Here’s the Leetcode75-style solution for the problem "Kids with the Greatest Number of Candies."

### Problem Breakdown:
We are given an array `candies`, where each element represents the number of candies a kid has. We are also given a number `extraCandies` which can be added to any kid's candy count. We need to determine, for each kid, whether giving them all the `extraCandies` would make their candy count greater than or equal to the maximum number of candies any kid currently has.

### Approach:
1. **Determine Maximum Candies**:
   - First, find the current maximum number of candies among all the kids.
   
2. **Check Each Kid**:
   - For each kid, calculate if their candies plus the `extraCandies` would be greater than or equal to the maximum number of candies.

3. **Result Array**:
   - Return a boolean array where each entry represents whether the corresponding kid will have the greatest number of candies if they receive the `extraCandies`.

### Python Solution:

```python
class Solution:
    def kidsWithCandies(self, candies: list[int], extraCandies: int) -> list[bool]:
        # Find the maximum number of candies any kid currently has
        max_candies = max(candies)
        
        # For each kid, check if their candies + extraCandies is >= max_candies
        result = [candy + extraCandies >= max_candies for candy in candies]
        
        return result

# Example 1
solution = Solution()
print(solution.kidsWithCandies([2, 3, 5, 1, 3], 3))  # Output: [True, True, True, False, True]

# Example 2
print(solution.kidsWithCandies([4, 2, 1, 1, 2], 1))  # Output: [True, False, False, False, False]

# Example 3
print(solution.kidsWithCandies([12, 1, 12], 10))     # Output: [True, False, True]
```

### Explanation:

1. **Find the Maximum Candies**:
   - We first find the maximum number of candies that any kid currently has using `max(candies)`.

2. **Compare Each Kid**:
   - For each kid in the array `candies`, we check if their current candy count plus the `extraCandies` is greater than or equal to the maximum. This comparison is done for each element in the `candies` array using a list comprehension.

3. **Return Boolean Array**:
   - We return the result as a list of booleans where each entry is `True` if the condition holds, and `False` otherwise.

### Time Complexity:
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where `n` is the number of kids. We make a single pass to find the maximum candies, and another pass to calculate the result for each kid.
  
- **Space Complexity**: O(n), where `n` is the length of the `candies` array, due to the space needed to store the result.

### Examples:

#### Example 1:
Input: candies = [2,3,5,1,3], extraCandies = 3
Output: [True, True, True, False, True]
Explanation: Each kid's candies after adding extraCandies:
- Kid 1: 2 + 3 = 5, which is the greatest.
- Kid 2: 3 + 3 = 6, which is the greatest.
- Kid 3: 5 + 3 = 8, which is the greatest.
- Kid 4: 1 + 3 = 4, which is not the greatest.
- Kid 5: 3 + 3 = 6, which is the greatest.
```

#### Example 2:
Input: candies = [4,2,1,1,2], extraCandies = 1
Output: [True, False, False, False, False]
Explanation: Even after adding extraCandies, no other kid can match the first kid.
```

#### Example 3:
Input: candies = [12,1,12], extraCandies = 10
Output: [True, False, True]
Explanation: Both Kid 1 and Kid 3 will have the greatest candies if given the extraCandies.
```

This approach efficiently checks each kid’s potential candy count after adding `extraCandies` and provides the correct result with minimal computation.
