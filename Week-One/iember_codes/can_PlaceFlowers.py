Here’s the Leetcode75-style solution for the problem "Can Place Flowers."

### Problem Breakdown:
We are given a flowerbed represented as an array of 0s and 1s. A 0 indicates an empty plot, and a 1 indicates a plot where a flower is already planted. We want to determine if we can plant `n` new flowers in the flowerbed without violating the rule that no two flowers can be planted in adjacent plots.

### Approach:
1. **Greedy Approach**:
   - We can iterate through the flowerbed array and check for positions where we can plant a new flower. A flower can be planted at position `i` if:
     - The current position `flowerbed[i]` is 0 (empty).
     - The previous position (`i-1`) and the next position (`i+1`) are either empty or out of bounds.
   - If a valid position is found, plant a flower by setting `flowerbed[i]` to 1 and reduce `n` by 1.
   - If `n` reaches 0, return `True` early since we have successfully planted all the flowers.

2. **Boundary Conditions**:
   - Handle the edge cases where the current position is at the start (`i == 0`) or the end (`i == len(flowerbed) - 1`).

3. **Result**:
   - If after traversing the array, we still have `n > 0`, return `False`.

### Python Solution:

```python
class Solution:
    def canPlaceFlowers(self, flowerbed: list[int], n: int) -> bool:
        length = len(flowerbed)
        for i in range(length):
            if flowerbed[i] == 0:
                # Check if the previous and next plots are empty or out of bounds
                prev_empty = (i == 0 or flowerbed[i - 1] == 0)
                next_empty = (i == length - 1 or flowerbed[i + 1] == 0)
                
                if prev_empty and next_empty:
                    # Plant a flower at position i
                    flowerbed[i] = 1
                    n -= 1
                    if n == 0:
                        return True
        
        # Return true if we have planted all required flowers, otherwise false
        return n <= 0

# Example 1
solution = Solution()
print(solution.canPlaceFlowers([1, 0, 0, 0, 1], 1))  # Output: True

# Example 2
print(solution.canPlaceFlowers([1, 0, 0, 0, 1], 2))  # Output: False
```

### Explanation:

1. **Iterate through the Flowerbed**:
   - We loop through each plot in the flowerbed. If a plot is empty (`flowerbed[i] == 0`), we check if both the previous plot (`i-1`) and the next plot (`i+1`) are either empty or out of bounds.

2. **Plant a Flower**:
   - If the current, previous, and next plots are all valid for planting (i.e., empty), we plant a flower by setting `flowerbed[i] = 1` and decrease the number of flowers (`n`) to be planted.

3. **Check for Early Termination**:
   - If we plant all `n` flowers before reaching the end of the flowerbed, we return `True` early. If after traversing the whole array we still have `n > 0`, return `False`.

### Time Complexity:
- **Time Complexity**: O(m), where `m` is the length of the flowerbed. We only traverse the array once.
  
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), as we are modifying the input flowerbed in place and only using constant extra space.

### Examples:

#### Example 1:
```plaintext
Input: flowerbed = [1,0,0,0,1], n = 1
Output: true
Explanation: We can plant one flower in the middle plot.
```

#### Example 2:
```plaintext
Input: flowerbed = [1,0,0,0,1], n = 2
Output: false
Explanation: We cannot plant two flowers without violating the no-adjacent-flowers rule.
```

### Constraints:
- The length of the flowerbed is between 1 and \(2 \times 10^4\).
- `flowerbed[i]` is either 0 or 1.
- There are no two adjacent flowers initially.

This approach ensures that the solution efficiently determines whether it’s possible to plant `n` flowers in the given flowerbed without violating the adjacency rule.
